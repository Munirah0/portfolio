                <p> 
                 Data is everywhere,
                 It is possible to access and collect data in many ways but sometimes the data has problems when it is collected from different resources ,therefore understanding data of quality is an essential part of data wrangling because any data-driven insight can only be as good as the data it was built ,now I would to focus on quality data because poor quality can severely harm a company => "bad data =bad decision"
                 
               </br> So data has been collected, right? Here's what you need to do right now: firstly, you need to  ask some questions such as :
                     Is the data consistent with the field's rules?
                     Is the data complete and accurate? 
                     How do we measure data quality?
                    
                    there are 6 dimensions that will allow you to understand how the quality of the data can be measured I'll mention them here.
                    <br>
                
                    1 - Accurcay : refers to confirm that the data is entered accurately , it means the data must be correct and realistic ,so if the data was entered incorrect that's maybe occur problem </br>
                    2 - Completeness: complete data indicates that there are no missing values and that it is sufficient for decision-making. <br>
                    3 - Consistency : refers to ensure that the data across all systems reflects the same information represented within a dataset.<br>
                    4 - Uniqueness : duplicate issues are very frequent when integrating multiple data sets  ,therefore, you must ensure that your data is not duplicated because this can lead to ambiguity in the representation of the data.<br>
                    5 - Timeliness : refers to the availability of information at the right time when we need it .</br>
                    6 - Validity : refers to ensure the information that conform to a specific format or follow business rules.
